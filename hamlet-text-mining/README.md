# hamlet-text-mining

This is a simple text mining and analysis of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* using `python3`. In here, I used this [online open version](http://erdani.com/tdpl/hamlet.txt). Since the whole play is available in `txt` format, I've used the module `requests` in order to get the full text from the url address.
