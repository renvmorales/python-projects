# hamlet-text-mining

This is a simple text mining and analysis of Shakespeare's **Hamlet** using `python3`. In here, I used this [online open version](http://erdani.com/tdpl/hamlet.txt) where the whole play is available in `txt` format. In order to download the full text, I connected the `requests` to the url address.
